          to herein as the “Service” or “Services”, which may be modified from
          time-to-time at the sole discretion of Nispand Private Limited).

          “us” or “we” refers to Nispand Private Limited. The term “Device”
          refers to the device which is used to access the Services including
          but not limited to computers, smart phones and tablets. The term “you”
          refers to the user of the Services. When you use or access any
          Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and all applicable
          laws, rules and regulations. You may also be asked to click “I accept”

          Services after we have posted modified Terms on the Site, you are
          indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If

        <ol className="alpha-list" type="a">
          <li>
            Our account holders may access the Services on a subscription
            fee-based program, which gives access to all content within the
            Services. You will only have access to the Services while your paid
            subscription is active and subsisting. You may have access to a free
            trial period of 30 days, which automatically converts to a paid
            annual or monthly subscription term after expiry of 30 days. In such
            instances, you can disable the automatic conversion by following the
            cancellation instructions prior to the date of conversion. You may
            access NISPAND in the following ways: by purchasing a subscription
            to the Services from the Website, within the Apps, where allowed by
            the App marketplace partners, or through a bundle with one or more
            of our bundle subscription partners. Please note that if you
            purchase a subscription through the Apple iTunes Store or our iPhone
            application, the sale is final, and we will not provide a refund.
            Your purchase will be subject to Apple’s applicable payment policy,
            which also may not provide for refunds. If you purchase a
            subscription through the Google Play store, the sale is final and we
            will not provide a refund. Your purchase will be subject to Google’s
            applicable payment policy, which also may not provide for refunds.
            If you purchase through one or more of our bundle subscription
            partners, the purchase may be further subject to the Terms and
            Conditions of such partners, and payment and management of the
            bundle subscription may be administered by them.

            You may access NISPAND via a monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, annual

            payment before the subscription period ends. You must cancel your
            subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next
